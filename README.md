Our project analyzed the effectiveness of the NFL combine in predicting the career readiness of offensive players in the NFL. Specifically, we focused on the offensive players who participated in the combine in 2018 and examined their first-year success in the league. By examining the correlation between combine performance and NFL career success, we aimed to provide insights to improve how NFL teams evaluate players and guide athletes in their preparation for their professional careers.

The NFL combine holds significant weight in an NFL hopeful's draft stock, often influencing team decisions and players' training priorities. However, there have been notable cases, such as Tom Brady, where poor combine performance did not hinder an athlete's remarkable success in the league. Therefore, we aimed to determine if the combine accurately identified NFL-ready players across different positions or if its importance should be reassessed.

We hypothesized that the degree to which combine performance predicted NFL readiness would vary by position. For example, we expected that positions requiring more skill, like quarterbacks, may not be as reliant on combine scores as other positions like linebackers. Furthermore, we anticipated that even in positions where combine performance was a strong predictor of NFL success, there would be exceptions‚Äîathletes with exceptional combine performances who did not excel in the league.

Ultimately, our analysis shed light on the benefits and limitations of the NFL combine, helping teams make more informed decisions when evaluating players and aiding athletes in understanding the most effective areas to focus their training efforts. By evaluating the relationship between combine performance and NFL career success, we contributed to the improvement of player analysis and preparation strategies in the NFL.

## üóÇÔ∏è Datasets

### Dataset 1: NFL Raw Downloadable Data
The NFL Raw Data dataset was downloaded from the <a href="https://www.advancedsportsanalytics.com/nfl-raw-data">Advanced Sports Analytics website</a>. It is a CSV file containing player fantasy football data and game information for each game from 2019 to 2023. The dataset had 26,600 rows and 68 columns, with a file size of approximately 6.7 MB. The structure of the dataset consisted of multiple rows per game, with each row corresponding to a player's performance in that game. The columns of interest were "winning_team," "vis_team," and "home_team." These columns were used to determine the winning team for each game. This dataset was used to calculate the win/loss percentage of each player's team in their first year and make adjustments to their career success scores based on this ratio.

### Dataset 2: NFL Combine Webscraped Data
The NFL Combine Data was obtained by web scraping from the <a href="https://nflcombineresults.com/nflcombinedata.php?year=2018&pos=QB&college=">NFL Combine Results website</a>. The data was retrieved for the year 2018 and specifically for quarterbacks. The data was organized in an HTML table format. The structure of the dataset included rows corresponding to players, with columns representing different combine metrics such as "Name," "40 Yard Dash," "Vertical Leap," "Broad Jump," "Shuttle," and "3Cone." These metrics were used to calculate the combine score for each player. The dataset provided insights into the combine performance of players, which was then combined with other data to analyze the correlation between combine performance and NFL career success.

### Dataset 3: ESPN Sport Core API Data
The ESPN Sport Core API Data was used to retrieve <a href="https://sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/football/leagues/nfl/athletes?limit=1000&active=true">NFL player information</a>, including career statistic and college career data. The data was obtained by making API requests to the ESPN API. The structure of the dataset was in JSON format and contained nested dictionaries. Each player's data was stored under the "athlete" key, with nested dictionaries representing different seasons of their career. This dataset provided comprehensive information about player performance across their entire NFL career. It was used to calculate career success scores and gain insights into the relationship between player performance and career success. The data from this dataset was combined with other datasets, such as combine scores, to draw meaningful conclusions.

## üõÄ Data Cleaning Process
In the data cleaning process, several steps were taken for each dataset to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data.

For the Combine Data, empty rows were removed to eliminate any unnecessary data. Empty strings were converted to "None" values to differentiate them from actual data entries. Additionally, position abbreviations in the dataset were standardized to match the abbreviations used in the API data.

In the Game Log Data, missing team names in the team name columns were filled by utilizing context clues from other available information. This involved examining the game details and cross-referencing with team information to assign the correct team names. Furthermore, a new column called "winning_team" was added to indicate the team that won each game. This was determined by aggregating the total number of wins per team.

For the API data, a pandas dataframe was created to organize the statistics that varied based on the player's position. This allowed for efficient data manipulation and analysis of the player statistics.

These data cleaning processes were crucial in ensuring the integrity and consistency of the data across the datasets. By addressing missing values, standardizing formats, and aggregating relevant information, the datasets were prepared for further analysis and insights to be drawn.

## üïµÔ∏è Data Insights

### Insight 1: Correlation between Combine Performance and Career Success by Position

Our analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between combine performance and career success for running backs (RBs) and wide receivers (WRs). This suggests that RB and WR prospects should prioritize their preparation for the NFL combine as it serves as a reliable indicator of their potential success in the league. However, an interesting finding was a negative correlation between combine performance and career success for safeties (Ss), implying that standout combine performances may not necessarily translate to success for this position.

### Insight 2: Top Combine Performers and NFL Success

Among the top combine performers in 2018, only Josh Allen stood out as a successful NFL player among quarterbacks (QBs). Nick Chubb was the sole running back (RB) who excelled at the combine and went on to have a good NFL career. Surprisingly, none of the wide receivers (WRs) or safeties (Ss) who dominated the combine have become prominent names in the NFL. This insight highlights the importance of considering on-field performance and other factors alongside combine results when evaluating prospects.

### Insight 3: High-Scoring Players and Under-the-Radar Performers

Analyzing touchdown scorers since 2019, we found that while Saquon Barkley received more attention for his combine performance, Nick Chubb has proven to be a slightly more effective NFL player. This analysis demonstrates the value of identifying productive players who may be flying under the radar and could be high-value acquisitions. Jeff Wilson Jr., for example, emerged as one of the most productive players from the 2018 combine, showcasing the potential of finding hidden gems in player analysis.

### Insight 4: Athletic Anomalies and NFL Success

Athletes who exhibited exceptional athleticism with a sub-4.5 40-yard dash time and a minimum of 20 reps on the bench press were considered athletic anomalies. While this combination of speed and strength is theoretically advantageous, few athletes in this category have achieved significant success in the NFL. Saquon Barkley stands out as an exception. Notably, Shaquem Griffin, despite having only one hand, excelled at the 2018 combine, demonstrating his determination and remarkable abilities.

### Insight 5: Variance of 40-Yard Dash Times by Position

The variance of 40-yard dash times differed across positions in the 2018 combine. Running backs (RBs) and safeties (Ss) displayed remarkably low variance, suggesting that focusing on improving their 40-yard dash times can significantly differentiate them from other athletes in their positions. On the other hand, linebackers (LBs) and quarterbacks (QBs) exhibited the highest variance, indicating that speed may be less crucial for these positions, or there is a wider range of talent levels competing in the combine for these positions.
